### Download

Get a ready to use binary
 - From our [XDA topic](https://forum.xda-developers.com/smartwatch/amazfit/app-widget-calendar-pace-t3751889)
 - From our [Github Releases](https://github.com/GreatApo/AmazfitPaceCalendarWidget/releases/latest)

Or if you are hardcore, compile the source code with Android Studio.



### Installation
To install this widget, you will need a PC with the ADB installed. Connect your Amazfit on your PC and fire up a terminal.

```shell
adb uninstall com.dinodevs.pacecalendarwidget
adb install -r PaceCalendarWidget.X.X.X.apk
adb shell am force-stop com.huami.watch.launcher
```



### Calendar Events: How To
There are 3 ways to get your calendar evens.
1. From phone: Install Amazmod (both phone+watch) and forward phone's stock calendar events
2. From iCalendar feed: Create the file "/sdcard/Android/data/com.dinodevs.pacecalendarwidget/files/pacecalendar.txt" and write your iCalendar feed url in the first line (eg. http://mysuperdupercalendar.ics). Your events will be updated from WiFi (be connected). Powered by [iCal4j](https://github.com/ical4j/ical4j) library.
3. From iCalendar local file: Put your ics file at "/sdcard/Android/data/com.dinodevs.pacecalendarwidget/files/" name as "calendar.ics". This file is been searched only if there is no URL of method 2 and WiFi is off.

For 2 & 3, after placing the files, press the events button, the Timeline will open, press the refresh icon
